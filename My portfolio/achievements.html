            In my journey through sports and extracurricular activities, I've achieved notable success in Silambam, reaching the state level, a testament to my dedication and hard work. Additionally, I proudly served as the House Captain for the red house at my school, demonstrating my leadership qualities. Beyond sports, I've also cultivated talents in various artistic pursuits, including drawing and singing, allowing me to express my creativity and passion. In addition to my athletic pursuits, I've excelled in shuttle, throwball, and hockey, showcasing my versatility in the sporting arena. Moreover, I've ventured into the world of combat sports, taking up boxing as a challenge that has helped me develop discipline and resilience. These achievements reflect my commitment to a well-rounded and balanced life, where both sports and the arts hold significant places.
